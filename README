Making new fighters:

This program uses the "convention over configuration idea".
The idea is that it's possible to make new fighters or stages, by just adding 
images of the frames, in the right folders. The fighters, stages, etc can then 
be further customized by creating editing an xml file in the corresponding 
folder. But the xml file is optional and if missing, the engine will simply 
fill in everything with default values based on the sizes of the images, etc.

Every fighter goes in the data/fighter folder, and every move goes in a folder
named after the move under that. Every frame of the move consists of a single
file, of which the name  begins with the name of the character, and underscore, 
the name of the move, and then either numbers or an underscore and numbers. 
All file names are in lower case. 

For example for a fighter names "Moe", with moves idle, walk and kick you'll 
need the following data folder layout and files:

data/fighter/moe/idle/moe_idle1.png 
data/fighter/moe/idle/moe_idle2.png
data/fighter/moe/idle/moe_idle3.png
data/fighter/moe/idle/moe_idle4.png ...
data/fighter/moe/walk/moe_walk1.png 
data/fighter/moe/walk/moe_walk2.png
data/fighter/moe/walk/moe_walk3.png
data/fighter/moe/walk/moe_walk4.png ...
data/fighter/moe/walk/moe_kick1.png 
data/fighter/moe/walk/moe_kick2.png
data/fighter/moe/walk/moe_kick3.png
data/fighter/moe/walk/moe_kick4.png ...

The xml, if any file goes here: 
data/fighter/moe.xml

For a stage name "outside" you'll only need: 
data/stage/outside/outside.png OR data/stage/outside/outside.jpg
The optional xml file goes here: 
data/stage/outside/outside.xml
